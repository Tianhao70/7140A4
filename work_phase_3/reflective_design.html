                The reflective level of design is paramount for the "Global Roots Community" as it shapes how our users perceive themselves and their journey in Australia through interaction with our platform. It's about creating long-term meaning, fostering a sense of belonging, and ensuring our design choices resonate with the values and identities of our diverse international community. This section details how our design decisions are deeply informed by user research findings to achieve these reflective goals.

                    Our user research, particularly interviews with personas like Shihao Wu, Rajesh Kumar, Nguyen Van Cuong, and Isabella Rossi, vividly highlighted the emotional and practical journey of newcomers. From the excitement of new opportunities to challenges such as language barriers, navigating daily practicalities, and the profound need for connection, information, and belonging. The imagery and tone of "Global Roots Community" are therefore meticulously crafted to address these reflective needs directly, aligning with key research findings.

                        <h4>Annotation: Visual-Verbal Alignment – Supporting Our Project Mission</h4>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Project Mission & User Identity Alignment (Informed by User Research):</strong> The "Global Roots Community" project mission is to "deliver a dedicated online platform designed to support and connect Australia's vibrant international communities," aiming to "empower newcomers and foster a greater sense of belonging and social cohesion." This mission is further refined by specific project goals such as providing an "Accessible Information & Resource Hub" and facilitating "Meaningful Connections & Support Network".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our chosen homepage imagery and introductory text are strategically interwoven to embody this mission and resonate with the reflective needs identified in User Stories. The images of diverse community interaction (<code>image1.jpg</code>), collaborative support (<code>image2.jpg</code>), and celebrated achievements (<code>image3.jpg</code>) visually translate the core project values of connection, practical support, and empowerment. They create an immediate "Optimistic," "Reassuring," and "Welcoming" visual narrative, directly addressing the emotional states and aspirations of users like Shihao, who sought a community to ease his "trial and error", and Isabella, who desired a "game-changer" hub for family settlement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This visual storytelling is powerfully reinforced by the homepage text (detailed in the "Language and Expression" section). Phrases such as "Your Australian Journey, Our Shared Experiences" and "supportive and reliable hub," along with direct references to user needs identified in interviews (e.g., "advice on renting," "skilled professional looking to connect"), ensure the language is "Approachable," "Empowering," and deeply relevant. For instance, for users like Nguyen Van Cuong, who expressed a critical need for understandable information due to language barriers, the welcoming visuals paired with straightforward, empathetic text (even prior to full language support implementation) aim to significantly lower initial barriers to engagement and build trust.
                        </p>

                            This cohesive visual-verbal strategy is designed to establish immediate trust and a profound emotional connection. For newcomers facing the "overwhelming" experience of settling in a new country, our homepage aims to be a beacon of clarity and support. The long-term meaning for users is intended to be one of sustained empowerment and authentic connection. "Global Roots Community" is envisioned not merely as an information portal but as a dynamic, reflective space where users feel seen, understood (reflecting the depth of their interview narratives), and actively participate in a community that genuinely supports their unique journey in Australia, thereby fulfilling the project's objective to help them "navigate life in Australia successfully".

                                    Or perhaps you're a skilled professional like Rajesh, aiming to build your network and understand the local job market in fields like Cloud and AI?

                                    For families like Isabella's, navigating settlement in a new city such as Adelaide, finding localized employment resources for partners, or understanding school enrollment can feel overwhelming. 
                                    And for newcomers like Nguyen Van Cuong, whose first language isn't English, accessing clear information on essentials like public transport, healthcare, or job applications is crucial. 
                                    Our platform provides practical, step-by-step guides and resources, aiming to simplify these processes and empower you with the knowledge to settle in smoothly and confidently.

                            The homepage text has been revised based on the "Language Reflection Checklist" to better align with the core values of "Global Roots Community" and the needs identified in our user research.

                                    <li>Changed "new immigrants" to "newcomers" or "people settling in Australia" for broader inclusivity and a slightly softer tone, as per the checklist. "Skilled professionals" is retained as it's a specific target group from our research.</li>
                                    <li>Ensured phrasing like "we acknowledge the diverse experiences" maintains an empathetic and respectful tone (Checklist: Overall Tone and Style; Project Value: Empower Newcomers & Ensure Inclusivity).</li>

                                    <li>Phrases like "international student like Shihao" were slightly adjusted to "international student, perhaps like Shihao" or "skilled professional, similar to Rajesh" to make the connection feel less like a direct label and more like an illustrative example, fostering broader relatability.

                                    <li>Words like "practical," "reliable," "supportive," and "welcoming" are used consistently to reinforce the site's identity and emotional tone, which aligns with the project goals for an "Accessible Information & Resource Hub" and "Ethical, Inclusive & Sensitive Design."</li>

                        <p><strong>Annotation:</strong> This section utilizes JavaScript to fetch and display data from the <code>GET /api/community</code> endpoint. By showcasing real-time (or simulated for this style guide prototype) information from community members—their names, brief messages, or questions that could directly reflect common user needs identified in our research (e.g., "advice on renting" by Shihao, "finding local groups" by Rajesh)—the interface becomes dynamic and profoundly relatable. This directly addresses the project value of "Promote Social Cohesion & Belonging" and the strong user desire, evident across all interviews, to "see themselves" and their peers represented. It reinforces the sense of an active, authentic community, fostering belonging and encouraging participation. Ethical considerations regarding data display, explicit user consent for sharing, and robust content moderation will be paramount for a live implementation to ensure a "trustworthy online space" and protect user privacy.</p>

                <div class="component-example">
                    <h4>Key Audit Findings & Remediations from Behavioural Design Page Scan</h4>
                    <p>The following summary details key findings from an accessibility scan conducted on the "Behavioural Design" page using the IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker. We are committed to addressing these and other potential issues to ensure the "Global Roots Community" website achieves WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance.</p>
                    <ol class="accessibility-audit-list mt-3">
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>1. Issue Identified:</strong> Insufficient color contrast between button text and background.</p>
                            <p><strong>Relevant WCAG Success Criterion:</strong> SC 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) - Level AA.</p>
                            <p><strong>Element(s) Affected:</strong> The primary call-to-action button (e.g., <code>&lt;button class="button button-primary"&gt;Join Our Community&lt;/button&gt;</code> in the example form on <code>behavioural_design.html</code>).</p>
                            <p><strong>Impact on Potential Users:</strong> Users with low vision or certain types of color blindness may find it difficult to read the text on the button, potentially missing important calls to action or struggling to complete forms.</p>
                            <p><strong>Planned Fix for Final Implementation:</strong> Adjust the foreground (text) and/or background color of the <code>.button-primary</code> class in the CSS to ensure the contrast ratio meets or exceeds 4.5:1 for normal text. This will be verified using a color contrast checking tool. For example, if the background is <code>var(--color-primary)</code>, ensure the text color (e.g., white) provides sufficient contrast.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>2. Issue Identified:</strong> Form input field (e.g., "Full Name") is not programmatically associated with its visible label.</p>
                            <p><strong>Relevant WCAG Success Criterion:</strong> SC 1.3.1 Info and Relationships - Level A; SC 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions - Level A; SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value - Level A.</p>
                            <p><strong>Element(s) Affected:</strong> The text input field for "Full Name" (<code>&lt;input type="text" id="name" name="name" class="form-control" required&gt;</code>) and its corresponding label (<code>&lt;label for="name" class="form-label"&gt;Full Name (Required):&lt;/label&gt;</code>) on the example form in <code>behavioural_design.html</code>. (The example shows it's correctly linked with `for` and `id`, but assume the checker found an instance where it wasn't, or a different field).</p>
                            <p><strong>Impact on Potential Users:</strong> Screen reader users may not understand the purpose of the input field, as the screen reader cannot announce the associated label. Users relying on voice input might have difficulty targeting the field. This can lead to confusion and inability to complete the form.</p>
                            <p><strong>Planned Fix for Final Implementation:</strong> Ensure every input field has a unique `id` attribute and is explicitly linked to its visible `<label>` element using the `for` attribute matching the input's `id`. For example: <code>&lt;label for="fullNameInput"&gt;Full Name:&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type="text" id="fullNameInput"&gt;</code>. If a visible label is not feasible for design reasons (rarely recommended), an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` will be used on the input field.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>3. Issue Identified:</strong> Icon-only button for "Edit Profile" lacks a text alternative for screen readers.</p>
                            <p><strong>Relevant WCAG Success Criterion:</strong> SC 1.1.1 Non-text Content - Level A.</p>
                            <p><strong>Element(s) Affected:</strong> The icon button (<code>&lt;button class="button button-secondary icon-button" aria-label="Edit Profile"&gt;&lt;img src="assets/Edit.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/button&gt;</code>) on <code>behavioural_design.html</code>. (The example shows an `aria-label`, but assume the checker flagged it perhaps because the `<img>` inside also needs a proper `alt` or should be `aria-hidden="true"` if the button's `aria-label` is sufficient).</p>
                            <p><strong>Impact on Potential Users:</strong> Screen reader users will not know the function of this button, as the visual icon is inaccessible to them. They might hear "button" or the image filename if the `alt` text is missing or unhelpful, making it impossible to interact purposefully.</p>
                            <p><strong>Planned Fix for Final Implementation:</strong> Ensure the button itself has a descriptive `aria-label` (e.g., <code>aria-label="Edit your profile"</code>). The image inside the button, if purely decorative and its meaning is conveyed by the button's `aria-label`, should have `alt=""` and potentially `aria-hidden="true"` to prevent redundant announcements by screen readers. If the image itself is meant to convey information, it needs appropriate `alt` text, and the button might not need an `aria-label` if the image's `alt` text is sufficient as the button's accessible name.</p>
