                <p>
                    This document outlines my use of Generative AI (GenAI) and Machine Translation (MT)
                    tools during the completion of DECO7140 Assessment 3: Design Proposal. This acknowledgement
                    and reflection adhere to the guidelines specified in the course's
                    <strong>GenAI & MT Usage Framework (Version 4)</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout this assessment phase, focused on creating a sitemap, style guide, and ethical response
                    for the "Global Roots Community" website, I primarily utilized the following AI tools:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Google Gemini and ChatGPT:</strong>
                        Used for brainstorming content descriptions for the sitemap, generating initial drafts for annotations
                        in the style guide (linking design decisions to user research, UX/UI theories, and accessibility),
                        assisting in identifying relevant WCAG 2.2 AA criteria for various design components,
                        helping draft sections of the ethical response, suggesting code improvements or checking for errors,
                        and providing alternative visual or structural solutions when I encountered creative blocks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Machine Translation (MT) tools (e.g., Google Translate):</strong>
                        Used sparingly to refine phrasing of technical terms or ensure clarity when translating my conceptual
                        notes into formal written English for the proposal. It was also used for understanding nuances in
                        English-language reference materials.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    My objective in using these tools was to enhance the depth of my design proposal, improve the efficiency
                    of my workflow, explore diverse design perspectives, and ensure the clarity and professionalism
                    of my documentation, while always ensuring the final work reflects my own critical analysis,
                    understanding, and design decisions.

                <h2 class="ack-section-title"><i class="fas fa-brain icon-before"></i>AI Reflection: My Experience in A3 (Design Proposal)</h2>

                <h4>1. How AI Was Used in A3</h4>
                <p>
                    For Assessment 3, I strategically employed GenAI tools to support various stages of developing the Design Proposal:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sitemap Development:</strong>
                        As noted in my "A3Ai使用.docx", I used AI to research similar websites for inspiration when planning the sitemap. After drafting initial versions, I also prompted AI to evaluate and compare sitemap structures (e.g., comparing "image_a758bd.png" with "image_a3448e.png"). AI helped articulate the benefits of a revised structure, such as changing "Guide" to "Community" and simplifying the hierarchy under "Community" by grouping specific topics under "Topics" and placing actions like "Latest Replies" parallel to it. This feedback was critically assessed against A3 requirements for annotations and user needs.
                        AI also assisted in brainstorming initial descriptions for the purpose and key features of each page in the sitemap, which I then refined to align with client and user needs derived from A2.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Style Guide Creation:</strong>
                        GenAI was particularly helpful in drafting initial annotations for the visceral, behavioural, and reflective design sections. For example, when defining typography rules or color palettes, I used AI to generate descriptive text linking these choices to readability (WCAG 1.4.3), emotional impact (Color Theory), and branding. For UI components like buttons and forms, AI helped list relevant Norman's principles (e.g., Affordance, Feedback, Constraints) and corresponding WCAG criteria (e.g., WCAG 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions for forms). I also used it to suggest alternative wording for justifications to ensure clarity and conciseness. When lacking specific visual ideas for a component, AI provided some general visual solution concepts for me to test and adapt.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Ethical Response Drafting:</strong>
                        For the `ethical_response.html`, AI assisted in structuring the memo and drafting initial paragraphs for sections like "Context Identification" and "Client Communication," based on my A2 ethical analysis. I then heavily edited these drafts to ensure the arguments were robust, directly referenced the ACS Code of Ethics, and reflected a professional tone.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Code Checking and Refinement:</strong>
                        Throughout the HTML and CSS development for the style guide pages, I used AI to check for syntax errors, suggest more efficient CSS selectors (e.g., for component skeletons), and provide advice on responsive design implementation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Accessibility Considerations:</strong>
                        AI helped in identifying relevant WCAG 2.2 AA success criteria for different design elements discussed in the style guide (e.g., for dynamic content in `reflective_design.html` or forms in `behavioural_design.html`). It also assisted in formulating how to describe these considerations in annotations.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="ai-example">
                    <p class="ai-prompt"><strong>Example AI Interaction (Sitemap Evaluation Summary):</strong></p>
                    <p><em>My Input:</em> "Compare sitemap A (image_a3448e.png) with sitemap B (image_a758bd.png) for the 'Global Roots Community' project. Which structure is better and why, focusing on clarity and user understanding?"</p>
                    <p><em>AI's Answer (Key Insights Utilized):</em></p>
                    <code>AI suggested the new sitemap (image_a758bd.png) was better due to:
- More accurate top-level naming ("Community" vs. "Guide").
- Clearer structure under "Community" with a dedicated "Topics" sub-section.
- Simpler hierarchy by removing an intermediate layer.</code>
                    <p><em>My Critical Evaluation & Action:</em> I agreed with AI's structural assessment regarding clarity and naming. However, I recognized this was based purely on visual structure and that the A3 marking criteria heavily relied on the quality of annotations. I then focused on ensuring my annotations for the chosen structure thoroughly justified each page's purpose, features, and accessibility in relation to user needs from A2 and client goals for "Global Roots Community." The AI's feedback acted as a good sounding board for the structural logic.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h4>2. How AI Supported My Learning in A3</h4>
                <p>
                    AI tools played a significant role in my learning and execution of A3:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Deepening Understanding of Design Principles:</strong> By prompting AI to explain how specific UX/UI theories (e.g., Emotional Design levels, Norman's Principles, Gestalt Principles) applied to my design components, I could articulate the rationale in my annotations more effectively.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Efficiency in Documentation:</strong> Drafting annotations and descriptive text is time-consuming. AI provided a solid first draft for many sections, allowing me to focus on critical thinking, refinement, and ensuring alignment with my A2 research and A3 requirements, rather than starting from a blank page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Exploring Alternatives:</strong> When stuck on how to best present a UI component or structure a section of the style guide, AI offered different organizational or visual ideas, broadening my perspective.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reinforcing Accessibility & Ethics:</strong> AI helped flag areas where accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA) and ethical considerations (ACS Code) needed explicit mention in the style guide and sitemap annotations, reinforcing their importance throughout the design proposal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Improving Code Quality:</strong> AI's ability to spot minor HTML/CSS errors or suggest cleaner code helped me maintain a higher standard of technical execution for the style guide website itself.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Critical Evaluation of AI's Effectiveness in A3</h4>
                <p>
                    AI tools were generally effective, but their use required careful management and critical oversight:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Strengths:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Excellent for brainstorming initial content and generating diverse phrasing for annotations.</li>
                            <li>Quickly identified relevant UX/UI theories or WCAG criteria when prompted with specific design elements.</li>
                            <li>Efficient for drafting professional-sounding text for sections like the ethical response.</li>
                            <li>Useful for suggesting solutions to common coding problems or for code review.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Limitations & Challenges:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Generic Outputs:</strong> AI-generated annotations often started quite generic and lacked the specific context of the "Global Roots Community" project or the nuances of my A2 user research. They required significant editing to become meaningful.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Depth of Analysis:</strong> While AI could list principles, it couldn't replicate the deep analytical connection between a specific design choice and a specific user need from A2 without very detailed prompting and iterative refinement from my side.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Understanding Nuance:</strong> For the ethical response, AI could draft standard arguments but struggled with the specific nuances of balancing funder requirements with user well-being in the CCI context without my explicit guidance and A2 analysis.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Accuracy of Technical Suggestions:</strong> Occasionally, AI's CSS or accessibility suggestions were not optimal or fully compliant, requiring verification against W3C documentation or course materials.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>My Strategies for Mitigation:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Iterative Prompting:</strong> Providing AI with context from A2 research and A3 goals, and refining prompts based on initial outputs.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Critical Review & Fact-Checking:</strong> Never accepting AI output at face value. All generated text, especially relating to UX theories, WCAG guidelines, or ethical reasoning, was cross-referenced with lecture notes and the A3 Assessment Task Sheet.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Substantial Modification:</strong> Treating AI outputs as a starting point. I actively rewrote, restructured, and added my own analysis to ensure the final proposal reflected my critical thinking and design intent. For instance, AI might suggest a standard button annotation, but I would then elaborate on how the specific color choice and iconography related to the "Global Roots Community's" desired emotional tone (Reflective Design).
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Focusing AI on Specific Sub-Tasks:</strong> Using AI for brainstorming or drafting specific, well-defined parts (e.g., "draft an annotation for this button focusing on 'Feedback' and 'WCAG 2.4.7'"), rather than asking it to create entire sections of the style guide.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4. Ethical Considerations in Using AI for A3</h4>
                <p>
                    My use of AI in A3 was guided by several ethical considerations:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Transparency and Acknowledgement:</strong> Fully disclosing the use of GenAI and MT tools, as detailed on this page, in line with the GenAI & MT Usage Framework.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Authorship and Originality:</strong> Ensuring that the core design decisions, critical analysis, and the overall design proposal genuinely represent my own intellectual effort and learning. AI was a tool for assistance, not a replacement for my design thinking and problem-solving.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Avoiding Over-Reliance:</strong> Consciously limiting AI's role to supportive tasks to ensure that I was developing and demonstrating my own skills in design, critical analysis, and professional communication as required by the learning outcomes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Bias Mitigation:</strong> Being aware that AI outputs can sometimes reflect biases present in their training data. I critically reviewed AI-generated content, especially regarding imagery suggestions or cultural sensitivity, to ensure it aligned with the inclusive values of the "Global Roots Community" project.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Accuracy and Responsibility:</strong> Taking full responsibility for the accuracy and quality of all submitted work, regardless of whether AI assisted in its drafting. This involved rigorous checking of any facts, principles, or guidelines mentioned.
                    </li>

                    In conclusion, GenAI tools were valuable assistants in the A3 Design Proposal process, particularly for drafting and refining textual content and exploring ideas. However, their effective and ethical use demanded constant critical engagement, significant refinement of their outputs, and a clear understanding that the core design thinking, user empathy, and ethical reasoning must originate from the human designer.
