                            This document outlines my use of Generative AI
                            (GenAI) and potentially Machine Translation (MT)
                            tools during the completion of the DECO7140
                            Assessment 2: Design Research. This acknowledgement
                            and reflection follow the guidelines set out in the
                            course's **GenAI & MT Usage Framework (Version 4)**.

                        <p>
                            Throughout this assessment phase, I primarily
                            utilized the following AI tools:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                **Google Gemini / ChatGPT (or similar large
                                language model):** Used for conceptual
                                understanding, code explanation, generating code
                                examples (like CSS styling), brainstorming, code
                                checking/debugging, and simulating user personas
                                for interviews.

                        <p>
                            My goal in using these tools was to enhance my
                            learning process, improve efficiency, and explore
                            different perspectives or solutions, while ensuring
                            the final work reflects my own understanding and

                            I confirm that I have adhered to the "Checklist for
                            Responsible AI Use in Assessment" provided in the
                            GenAI & MT Usage Framework throughout this task. Key

                                **Before Prompting AI:** Selecting appropriate
                                tools for the task (e.g., using LLMs for
                                explanation or persona simulation, not for
                                writing entire analyses), being mindful of AI
                                limitations (potential bias, inaccuracies), and
                                avoiding input of sensitive personal data.

                                **When Using AI-Generated Content:** Critically
                                reviewing outputs for accuracy, bias, and
                                relevance; verifying information (especially

                                or reliable sources; and significantly

                        <p>
                            The GenAI & MT Usage Framework requires a reflection
                            on how AI was used, how it supported learning, its
                            effectiveness, and ethical considerations. Here's my
                            experience during this assessment:
                        </p>

                        <h4>1. How AI Was Used</h4>
                        <p>
                            I integrated GenAI into several aspects of my A2
                            workflow:
                        </p>

                                I felt uncertain about specific code concepts or
                                lecture materials, I used AI (like
                                Gemini/ChatGPT) to get explanations, helping me
                                consolidate foundational knowledge. For
                                particularly complex lecture sections, AI helped
                                break down the content into more digestible
                                parts.

                                utilized AI to review sections of my code,
                                asking it to check for potential flaws,
                                redundancy, or suggest
                                improvements. It was also helpful in debugging,
                                often quickly identifying syntax errors or logic
                                issues I might have overlooked.

                        <h4>2. How AI Supported Learning</h4>
                        <p>
                            For me, AI acted primarily as a supportive learning
                            partner:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                It provided **on-demand explanations**, which
                                was invaluable for consolidating basic concepts
                                when I encountered difficulties outside of class
                                time.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It allowed me to explore complex topics at my
                                own pace, leading to a **faster, easier, and
                                deeper understanding** than relying solely on
                                static materials.

                                Generating code examples (like the CSS) gave me
                                **practical starting points** that I could then
                                analyze, modify, and learn from, rather than
                                just copying.

                                **freed up cognitive load**, allowing me to
                                focus more on the *logic* and *design
                                principles* rather than getting stuck on minor
                                syntax errors.

                        <p>
                            AI tools were generally very effective, but it's
                            crucial to recognize their limitations:

                                <strong>Strengths:</strong> AI excelled at
                                providing quick explanations, generating
                                boilerplate or example code (like CSS styling or
                                basic structures), brainstorming ideas, and
                                rapidly identifying syntax errors during
                                debugging. The value box CSS solution, for
                                example, was a useful and effective suggestion.
                                Simulating personas offered valuable, diverse
                                input quickly.

                                        seamlessly within my existing CSS
                                        structure (e.g., ensuring variable names
                                        matched, styles didn't conflict).

                                consciously treated AI output as a **first draft
                                or suggestion**, never as a final product. I
                                made it a point to:
                                <ul>

                                        **Verify:** Cross-reference AI
                                        explanations with lecture notes,
                                        W3Schools, MDN, or other reliable
                                        sources.

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                **Transparency:** Fully acknowledging the use of
                                AI tools and the extent of their contribution,
                                as documented on this page, is fundamental.
                            </li>

                                **Avoiding Over-reliance & Ensuring Learning:**
                                The most significant ethical challenge for me
                                was ensuring AI enhanced, rather than replaced,
                                my learning. I actively pushed myself to
                                understand the 'why' behind AI suggestions and
                                to perform the core critical analysis myself.
                                It's crucial to **avoid letting AI undermine
                                foundational skill development or critical
                                thinking.

                                generation, I tried to be aware of potential
                                biases in the AI's training data and critically
                                reviewed the outputs to ensure they felt
                                reasonably authentic and avoided harmful
                                stereotypes, refining prompts as needed.

                                the final submitted work, ensuring it accurately
                                reflects the project requirements and my own
                                capabilities.

                                sensitive personal information or confidential
                                project details into public AI tools.

                            leveraging it ethically and effectively requires
                            ongoing critical engagement, verification, and a
                            clear focus on using it as a tool to augment, not
                            replace, human understanding and creativity.
